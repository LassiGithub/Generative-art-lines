# Description

This is a generative art script. It generates art based on randomness, so you get different results every time you run it. You can also adjust the two sliders on the page, or some of the variables in setup(), to get different looking art.

This project uses some functions of the open source library p5.js: https://p5js.org/

For more information on how the art is generated, you can read the comment at the top of the sketch.js file.
